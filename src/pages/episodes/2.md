As part of our work, we will sometimes put a new system under scrutiny in order to provide constructive feedback, and/or clear up a widespread misunderstanding that could lead to problems down the road (for example, see our series on <a href="/tag/certificate-transparency/">Certificate Transparency</a>).<!--more-->

Today, we continue this tradition by reviewing one of the lesser known details of the <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash cryptocurrency</a>. A few days prior to publication, we reached out to the Zcash team and asked them to review this post for accuracy. We thank them for subsequently posting <a href="https://z.cash/blog/snark-parameters.html">more details</a> about Zcash's <em>trusted setup.</em>

Type "zcash" into any search engine today and you'll most likely stumble across <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/zcash-an-untraceable-bitcoin-alternative-launches-in-alpha/">this WIRED article</a>.
