Welcome to Group Income 2.0: private community software with a financial safety net, so you can focus on what matters.

## The Final Breaking Changes

Group Income 2.0 introduces polish and a solidified foundation for all future versions.

Unlike most web software, Group Income is built on top of an [open decentralized protocol](https://shelterprotocol.net).

This has pros and cons.

Pros:

- Users are guaranteed that unlike Facebook, X, Apple, Google, and every other Big Tech megacorp out there, our software will behave in a predictable manner that can be verified by anyone.
- Our software will outlive proprietary Big Tech software that is constantly being modified and end-of-lifed.
- Anyone can build on top of our protocol and have their software interact with ours.

Cons:

- There is one major drawback: any time we need to make a fundamental change to the protocol, we have to reset the server. This means all groups have to be recreated from scratch.

This version makes final breaking changes to the protocol Group Income is built upon, laying down the foundation for the rest of the software's life, and requiring a final server reset.

Existing users can find a read-only archive of their old groups at this URL: https://archive.groupincome.org
